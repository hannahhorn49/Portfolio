## Auto Dataset
This project uses a real world auto dataset which contains information about cars manufactured and sold in the 1970s. 

The duplicates were identified and the missing values were handled two ways, one approach removed all instances with NA values while another replaced the NAs with the corresponding attribute's average value.
